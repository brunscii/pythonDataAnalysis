These are notebooks to help me with the projects on freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python certificate.
Each notebook will have a corresponding replit that is based on the template from freeCodeCamp

The projects are 
- Mean-Variance-Standard Deviaion Calculator
- Demographic Data Analyzer
- Medical Data Visualizer
- Page View Time Series Visualizer
